## üòé Overview

This addon adds 5 new graphs (double bezier, arc, sigmoid, polyline and interpolated) to the native Graph Mapper and provides a new Graph Mapper component with input domains (source and target domains), which allows remapping the values to the target domain.

## ‚úã Disclaimer
I have updated this 2018 plugin to work for Rhino 7 because many people have asked me for it.
The original code was lost on a damaged external hard drive, I have recovered it using a disassembler on the .gha and so the code does not have my style but is a quick fix of the disassembler errors.
If you want to see how I program, please visit any other recent project, not this one.

## üîå Installation
0) Download the last release of RichedGraphMapper.gha from [food4Rhino](https://www.food4rhino.com/app/riched-graph-mapper).
1) Make sure RichedGraphMapper.gha is unlocked, right click > Properties > Unlock (if visible).
2) Copy and paste it in the Grasshopper Libraries folder, usually: C:\Users\<YourUser>\AppData\Roaming\Grasshopper\Libraries.
3) Restart Rhinoceros and Grasshopper.
4) Access the component from Maths > Util or from the native Graph Mapper component menu > Graph types.
